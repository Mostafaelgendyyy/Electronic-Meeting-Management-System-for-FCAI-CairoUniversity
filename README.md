## INTRODUCTION
- It’s 2023, the whole world is moving towards digitalizing  everything
- Faculties related to Computers and AI specifically  are striving to create their own web applications and are gradually transforming processes created manually to digital processes
- Since the meeting handling process in FCAI is one carried out frequently, we believe handling it electronically is a huge step forward to creating our own fully functioning web application
## MOTIVATION
- FCAI is the source of moving towards technology and digital life, the way meetings are being handled manually in the faculty doesn’t seem fit
- Paperwork and excess amount of documents are created and stored to handle the process
- Since dealing with excess load of paperwork isn’t reliable and is, to an extent, tiring, creating a system that handles at least a larger percentage of the process seemed logical
## PROPOSED SOLUTION
- We created a system handles meetings process, starting from how the topics enter the system
- It also handles how subject controller puts subjects up to be discussed in the meeting
- In addition to handling the meeting creation process, publishing meeting agendas to participate in higher level meetings
- Finally it has an archiving features for meetings to be found easily through search
